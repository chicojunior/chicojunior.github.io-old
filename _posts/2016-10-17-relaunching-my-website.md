Ok, here I am again relaunching my website, cv and blog. This time was different. I back to "date" with ruby and I decided to create my website again, using jekyll withou fork a repo. I just use [this tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). I liked of the "minimalist" example used and this will be my website for now. I will study more Jekyll and Ruby to improve my wwebsite. For now that is all. Bye!
